## üîß Implementation Highlights

### 1. PAC (Personal Autonomous Creation) System
```elixir
# Complete PAC lifecycle management
{:ok, pac} = Thunderline.PAC.create(%{name: "Alice", traits: ["curious"]})
{:ok, agent_pid} = Thunderline.PAC.Manager.activate_pac(pac)
# PAC is now autonomous and reasoning independently
```

### 2. AI Reasoning Pipeline
```elixir
# 4-phase autonomous reasoning
{:ok, tick_result} = Thunderline.Tick.Pipeline.execute_tick(pac, context)
# Returns: assessment, decision, execution_result, memory, narrative
```

### 3. MCP Tool System
```elixir
# Extensible tool execution
{:ok, result} = Thunderline.MCP.ToolRouter.execute_tool(
  "memory_search", %{"query" => "recent events"}, context
)
```

### 4. Memory Management
```elixir
# Semantic memory operations
{:ok, memories} = Thunderline.Memory.Manager.get_relevant_memories(
  pac_id, "learning experiences", 10
)
```
