## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS - CRYSTAL CLEAR PRIORITY**

### 🔥 **Day 1-2: Tick System Port** ⚡ URGENT
**Source**: `thunderline.old/tick/`  
**Target**: `lib/thunderline/tick/`  
**Components**:
```
thunderline.old/tick/orchestrator.ex → lib/thunderline/tick/orchestrator.ex
thunderline.old/tick/pipeline.ex     → lib/thunderline/tick/pipeline.ex  
thunderline.old/tick/tick_worker.ex  → lib/thunderline/tick/tick_worker.ex
thunderline.old/tick/log.ex          → lib/thunderline/tick/log.ex
```

### 🔥 **Day 2-3: Jido AI Agents Port** ⚡ CRITICAL
**Source**: `thunderline.old/agents/`  
**Target**: `lib/thunderline/agents/`  
**Components**:
```
thunderline.old/agents/pac_agent.ex              → lib/thunderline/agents/pac_agent.ex
thunderline.old/agents/actions/assess_context.ex → lib/thunderline/agents/actions/assess_context.ex
thunderline.old/agents/actions/make_decision.ex  → lib/thunderline/agents/actions/make_decision.ex
thunderline.old/agents/actions/execute_action.ex → lib/thunderline/agents/actions/execute_action.ex
thunderline.old/agents/actions/form_memory.ex    → lib/thunderline/agents/actions/form_memory.ex
thunderline.old/agents/actions/ai_provider.ex    → lib/thunderline/agents/actions/ai_provider.ex
```

### 🔥 **Day 3-4: Memory & Narrative Integration**
