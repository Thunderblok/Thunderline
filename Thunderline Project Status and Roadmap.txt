Thunderline Project Status and Roadmap
Project Status Overview 
Thunderline’s standalone foundation is in place and aligns with the requirements we set. The team
successfully forked Thunderline from Bonfre and rebuilt the core on a modern Phoenix/Ash/Oban stack,
application is scafolded and running on its own (no Bonfre dependency) with the PAC agent system,
memory system, MCP interface, etc., all set up. Documentation confrms that the project structure is well-
and analysis phases (Phases 1–3) were completed meticulously – architecture validated, code portability
thorough, giving us a solid starting point with 100% of core logic preserved and confgured in the new
repo. 
At this point, Thunderline’s “engine” is built and we’re ready to drive forward into integration. All systems
are “locked and loaded” on the new platform, and the project is on track to meet the goal of an independent
AI agent substrate. The confdence level is very high thanks to the clean groundwork laid so far.
Repository Structure and Key Components 🗂
The repository is cleanly structured for the new standalone app. Key directories include: 


2. Memory Manager – Handles the AI agents’ memory system. It stores and retrieves memories (with
vector similarity search for semantic recall) and manages a graph of memory nodes and edges. This
allows agents to have persistent, searchable memories over time.
3. MCP Server & Tool Registry – The Model Context Protocol component. It provides a standardized
interface (over WebSocket and JSON) for tools and AI models to interact with Thunderline. The Tool
Registry registers built-in tools (for creating agents, querying state, etc.) so that AI agents or external




very well – the new Thunderline app was initialized and runs as a standalone Phoenix web application.
Key achievements in Phase 3: 
• Phoenix framework up and running (with LiveView support) 
• Ash framework integrated for our data models (PAC.Agent, PAC.Zone, PAC.Mod, MemoryNode,
memory graph, which means the database layer and APIs for those are ready. 
• Database schema migrated – All tables (agents, zones, mods, memory nodes/edges, etc.) and even
vector indexing for embeddings are set up via Ecto migrations. This was marked 100% complete (we





have no UI yet for Thunderline’s features. This is okay (our priority is backend logic), but we must
remember to implement some UI/monitoring soon, even if rudimentary, for testing and






conceptually hard (especially compared to the AI logic), but it will require some time. It’s worth
noting as debt because if we delay it, we might have a fully functional backend with no easy way to
observe it or control it in real time. The docs explicitly fag the web interface as something needing
attention soon 38 , so it’s on our to-do list.
In summary, the outstanding issues are all known and manageable. The team has not ignored them –
they’re either being worked on or scheduled next. The phrase “sweeping under the rug” is apt only in the
sense that they temporarily pushed aside resolving compile errors to keep coding the logic. That was an
acceptable trade-of to maintain momentum, but we haven’t lost sight of those issues. We have a checklist
for the minor integration tasks that includes updating any broken imports, fxing dependency confgs, and
testing everything together 24 . None of the technical debt items appear to require a fundamental
redesign; they are mostly fnish-line tasks: implementing stubs, removing temporary code, and
tightening bolts. We will address each of them as we progress through integration.
Path Forward (Next Steps) 
Going forward, the path is clear and “even a child could fnish putting it together” – thanks to the very
detailed roadmap the team has created. To ensure we complete Phase 4 and beyond successfully, here is
the action plan distilled into straightforward steps:
1. Finish Porting the Tick System: Complete the remaining pieces of the tick engine. This means


basic version might just concatenate the agent’s action and outcome into a sentence. The important
part is that the Narrative Engine exists and doesn’t crash when called. Additionally, we might create


extension, confguring environment variables for secrets (OpenAI keys, etc.), and CI/CD pipelines.
The documentation already lists these tasks in Phase 6 40 41 . We should also not forget to deploy a
staging environment to do a fnal test in an environment close to production.
13. Longer Term Enhancements: Looking beyond the immediate, Phase 7 in the plan outlines future
enhancements (multi-model AI support, advanced memory features, distributed architecture, etc.
42 43 ). These are not a focus now, but it’s good to keep them in mind as potential next projects
once the core is delivered. They don’t afect our current deliverables except that our architecture
should be fexible enough to accommodate them (which it is, given the modular design).
Throughout this path, a key strength is our comprehensive documentation and task tracking. The
MASTER_TASK_LIST and other docs break down everything we need to do 44 . This means anyone joining
the project or picking up a task can quickly get oriented. We should continue to update these docs as we
complete tasks, so the “map” stays current. Right now, that map is excellent – it’s very clear what remains,
and in what order. 
Finally, to answer the underlying concern: Yes, things are proceeding as they are supposed to. The team
is following the roadmap step by step, and not skipping the critical parts. The few compile issues and
unfnished bits are known issues on that roadmap, not signs of a fundamentally wrong direction. In fact, the
thorough planning in early phases is paying of: we have encountered no unresolvable blockers, only
predictable tasks. 
Our job now is to keep the momentum. We act as the “wind beneath their wings” by continuing to guide
and verify each step. Based on the evidence, we are still fying steady toward the target. The technical
debt is under control and will be paid down as we integrate. With the path forward laid out as above, even a
relatively new developer could pick up pieces and contribute, because the project’s structure and plans are
so well-defned. We’ll monitor the completion of each item, ensure tests are written, and maintain
documentation, and that will carry Thunderline to a successful completion of this migration. 
Bottom Line: The Thunderline project is structurally sound and on course. By executing the next
integration tasks and addressing the small known issues, we’ll have a fully operational system very soon.
We have a clear map and a manageable set of to-dos – so as long as we methodically knock them out,
Thunderline will soar as intended .
